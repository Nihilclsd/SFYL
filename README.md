SFYL

This application will help you find your own style and give advice for your image
# How virtual stylist works:

- determine your type of appearance and characteristic color type based on your photo
- choose a clothing model
- give individual advice
- suggest products from the store based on the recommendations received
# What should the user do to get advice/recommendations:

- register your profile
- send a photo of your face in natural light (so the answer will be correct)
- choose your body type from the selection
# Also the user can:

- create your own images
- give and receive advice from other users
- pluck clothes from a catalog

The application will be relevant both for stylists and for ordinary users. A virtual stylist gives you the opportunity to express yourself, help yourself or others.
